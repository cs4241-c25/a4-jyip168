**Summary:**
- My project is a to-do list web application for artists to add and view commissions for their clients.
- I didn't make any major changes to the core functionality of the project. The main changes were in converting the application 
from mainly a JS/Express application to an application with a React (w/ Router) frontend with an Express JS backend. The frontend
renders pages with React functionality, while the backend handles MongoDB requests and Github Passport Auth.
